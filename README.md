# "Getting and Cleaning Data" Final course project - Coursera

This repository contains my course project for the third course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization ; "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The project uses the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set, to perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

There are 5 main steps for the R script that outputs the tidy dataset;

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

IN ORDER TO REPRODUCE THIS PROJECT:
- Run the R script "run_analysis.R" , the script will output the following tidy data set: "final_tidydata.txt"

more details about this project will be in the codebook.md
